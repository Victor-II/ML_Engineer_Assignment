## `data`
Contains the annotated dataset used for training and evaluation, `dataset.json`. The dataset is in JSON lines format, each record having the following form: `{"url_id": url_id, "tokens": [token1, token2, ...], "ner_tags": [tag1, tag2, ...]}`. The dataset holds a total of 31369 records (extracted from a total of 258 urls), 11466 of which (extracted from 75 urls) were manually annotated and used for training and evaluation. The rest of the urls provided in `furniture stores pages.csv`, which was renamed as `urls.csv` eighter raised bad status codes or various errors, so text could not be extracted from them.

## `models`
Contains the best performing model resulted from training on `dataset.json`, `best_model`. This model was used to obtain the final results. The model folder was generated by `transformers.Trainer`.

## `results`
Contains the final results as given by `best_model`. `results_lines.json` stores the results in JSON lines format, while `results.json` stores the results in regular JSON, making it much less readable, but more convenient to use in code. Each record in `results_lines.json` is of the form `{"url_id": url_id, "url": url, "product": product}`. `url_id` is the index of the url in `urls.csv`, and `product` represents a product entity extracted from that url, as predicted by `best_model`.

Here are some result samples from unseen data:
